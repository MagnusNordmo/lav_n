This repository contains the simulation code, datasets, and analysis scripts used in the article  
**_Special Needs Education Requires Large Samples: An Introduction and Overview_**.

## Overview

This project investigates the statistical challenges faced in special needs education research, particularly the consequences of small sample sizes. We combine simulation-based demonstrations with a review of Norwegian and international studies to assess whether current research is adequately powered to detect small but practically relevant effects.
